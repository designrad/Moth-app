**Note about iOS version**

iOS app was unfortunately put into "Made for Kids" category in App Store, and it was incorrectly accepted by Apple. The update in Sep 2018 was under a lot of scrutiny, and due to the Kids Category, all external links (URLs, emails) had to be removed, or built a Parental Gate. Therefore the app is crippled on iPhones. It's now removed from Made for Kids, but since it's already installed on iphones, Apple is still reviewing it as being in the category.

*What to do next (in 2019)?*
1. _Create a regular copy of the app, with all links etc._
    - Submit with a new ID(?) and prepare for App Store. Maybe the name needs to be changed, too? MÃ¥lerjakt Pro? How to handle 2 versions with same name?
    - Notify users that their history will be deleted from the app.
2. _Create a simple update to existing app, which shows a text to users and asks them to remove the app, and reinstall from App Store_
3. _Cross fingers that active users will remove and re-install the regular version from App Store._

**Install and maintenance (on Android)**

1. _Clone project, if needed:_ 
    `git clone https://github.com/designrad/Moth-app.git`

2. _(Make changes, if needed:)_
    `npm install`
    
3. _(Change versionCode and versionName in android/app/build.gradle (ca line 100-101 by incrementing +1:)_
        
4. _Install requirements:_
    `npm install`
    
5. _Create signed APK bundle on terminal:_
    - add keystore passwords to `android/gradle.properties`
    - run in android directory: `./gradlew assembleRelease`
    - removed password, so not to accidentally push to github
    
6. _If you prefer, you can generate signed APK also in Android Studio:_
    - open android in Android Studio
    - select Build / Generate Signed APK
    - use correct keystore and key..

7. _Create new Release in Google Play Console, Release Dashboard_
    https://play.google.com/apps/publish/
    
8. _Commit and push any changes to Github:_
    `git commit -am 'YOUR COMMENT HERE'`
    `git push -u origin master`
    
Good luck!

PS. From Oct 2018, all updates need to target targetSdkVersion 26 or higher. Update in Sep 2018 was still done with v23. V26 seems to mess up Android 8.0.0 map (Samsung S8) so that it won't show markers.
